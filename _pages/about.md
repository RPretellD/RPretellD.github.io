<!-- ## **<u>WELCOME</u>** -->

## Welcome! 

I'm **Renmin Pretell**, Assistant Professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering 
at the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR). 

<!-- ## **<u>ABOUT THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</u>** -->

Before joining UNR in 2023, I spent over a decade in both industry and academia. I was a postdoctoral scholar 
with the Garrick Institute for the Risk Sciences (GIRS) at the University of California, Los Angeles. 
I also worked as a consulting engineer with Golder Associates in its offices in Lima (Peru) and Denver (CO), 
mainly focused on tailings dams projects. I hold a PhD and MS in Civil and Environmental Engineering 
from the University of California, Davis; and a BS in Civil Engineering from the National University of Engineering 
(UNI) in Peru. 


<!-- ## **<u>OUR RESEARCH</u>** -->

Our research aims to advance the performance assessment of geotechnical systems and infrastructure by 
integrating field and experimental data, with numerical simulations and analytics. Our research interests 
include seismic site response and ground motions, soil spatial variability and subsurface uncertainty, 
mine tailings and soil liquefaction effects. 

My combined experience in industry and academia shaped my goal of bridging the two. 
We aim to study real-world problems with a fundamental perspective to produce knowledge that is scientifically sound 
and useful to the industry.
